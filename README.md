# Gfytti

Gfytti allows you to use gifs on the HoloLens. It's a very scrappy demo with a lot of filler scenes at the moment. Watch the [video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKMM6AHuf8A).

# The Pitch

We've seen gfycat on our computers. We've seen gfycat on our mobile devices.
And we now we'll use gfycat on our untethered mixed reality devices!

Our team is called Gfytti! We bring a new level of immersion and interaction to gifs on the web.
Instead of just watching gifs. Instead of just visting a gfycat link, Gfytti allows the user
to interact with the gfycat. Gfycats become a part of your environment.

We had two main objectives for Gfytti: interaction and immersion.

We wanted to do more than just view and make gifs.

There are two main menus to Gfytti: Trending and GeoLocation.

A user is welcomed by the gif of the day.
He can interact with the gif. With a pinch gesture, he can push it toward him and away from him.
He can play with the gif or throw it away.

He's now on the trending page. Our objective was to make every experience with Gfytti a unique one.

Every time the user opens up Gfytti, the app scans the user's current room and location.
Once the room is scanned, the trending gifs are dynamically put on the walls.
They're never put in the same place each time you run the app.

We wanted gfycat to be more social too, so we built a geolocation page. I

A user can search for a gif and leave it for everyone else.
He can put a gfycat on the wall, so that other people who walk by can see his great gfycat.

There's social interaction with these gfycats because
they become a part of your environment and can be shared with others.

Gfytti is a way to use gfycat on our untethered mixed reality devices! It's a new way to interact with gifs. 
It's a new way to socialize with gifs. They become a part of your environment and become a fun way
to play around with gifs. That's Gfytti.
